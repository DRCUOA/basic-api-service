Initial implementation of task management API server

This commit introduces a complete Express.js-based REST API for task management
with PostgreSQL database integration. The implementation follows a layered
architecture pattern with clear separation between routes, controllers, services,
and data access objects (DAOs).

Key features include Express 5.2.1 server with task CRUD endpoints, Sequelize ORM
integration with PostgreSQL, migration-only schema control (sync() method is
poisoned for safety), Winston logging system, architecture documentation with
PlantUML diagrams, environment-based configuration via dotenv, and database
connection pooling with error handling.

The codebase includes full CRUD operations, defensive programming practices to
prevent runtime schema mutations, and structured logging. Sequelize CLI is
configured for migrations, ensuring schema changes are version-controlled.
